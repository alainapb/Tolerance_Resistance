# Tolerance_Resitance

Experiment Run by Alaina Pfenning-Butterworth and Jessica Hite assisted by Rachel Vetter and KA (undergraduates)

7 hour exposure assays (M. bicuspidata) run at 3 spore levels ( 0, 150, 300 spores/ml) with 4 D. dentifera genotypes (A'45, Midland 252, Midland 281, Standard)

Data collected: 
                feeding rate at exposure (6 days old), 
                size at exposure, 
                infection status, 
                infection intensity, 
                size at end of exp. (20 days old),
                offspring (6 days old until 20 days old)
                active phenoloxidase (20 days old)
                spore yield (units?)
